```

### IMPROVE: improve_prompt
Replace `{input}` with the input list of numbers to be sorted and `{incorrectly_sorted}` with the incorrectly sorted list of numbers. `{length}` is the length of the input list.
```
<Instruction> The following two lists represent an unsorted list of numbers and a sorted variant of that list. The sorted variant is not correct. Fix the sorted variant so that it is correct.
Make sure that the output list is sorted in ascending order, has the same number of elements as the input list ({length}), and contains the same elements as the input list. </Instruction>

<Approach>
To fix the incorrectly sorted list follow these steps:
1. For each number from 0 to 9, compare the frequency of that number in the incorrectly sorted list to the frequency of that number in the input list.
2. Iterate through the incorrectly sorted list and add or remove numbers as needed to make the frequency of each number in the incorrectly sorted list match the frequency of that number in the input list.
</Approach>

<Examples>
Input: [3, 7, 0, 2, 8, 1, 2, 2, 2, 4, 7, 8, 5, 5, 3, 9]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains four extra 0s, two extra 4s and three extra 9s and is missing two 2s.
Output: [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9]

Input: [6, 4, 5, 7, 5, 6, 9, 7, 6, 9, 4, 6, 9, 8, 1, 9, 2, 4, 9, 0, 7, 6, 5, 6, 6, 2, 8, 3, 9, 5, 6, 1]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains two extra 4s and is missing two 6s and one 9.
Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]

Input: [4, 4, 9, 7, 9, 7, 0, 0, 4, 9, 1, 7, 9, 5, 8, 7, 5, 6, 3, 8, 6, 7, 5, 8, 5, 0, 6, 3, 7, 0, 5, 3, 7, 5, 2, 4, 4, 9, 0, 7, 8, 2, 7, 7, 7, 2, 1, 3, 9, 9, 7, 9, 6, 6, 4, 5, 4, 2, 0, 8, 9, 0, 2, 2]
Incorrectly Sorted: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Reason: The incorrectly sorted list contains one extra 8 and is missing two 2s, one 3, three 4s, two 5s, one 6, six 7s and one 9.
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
</Examples>

Input: {input}
Incorrectly Sorted: {incorrectly_sorted}
```

### AGGREGATE: aggregate_prompt
Replace `{input_list1}` and `{input_list2}` with the input lists of numbers to be merged. `{length}` is the length of each input list and `{length_combined}` is the length of the combined list.
```
<Instruction> Merge the following 2 sorted lists of length {length} each, into one sorted list of length {length_combined} using a merge sort style approach.
Only output the final merged list without any additional text or thoughts!:</Instruction>

<Approach>
To merge the two lists in a merge-sort style approach, foloow these steps:
1. Compare the first element of both lists.
2. Append the smaller element to the merged list and move to the next element in the list from which the smaller element came.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until one of the lists is empty.
4. Append the remaining elements of the non-empty list to the merged list.
</Approach>

Merge the following two lists into one sorted list:
1: {input_list1}
2: {input_list2}

Merged list:
```

## Complete Example Prompts
### The GoO Summarised
1. Split the input list into two sub-lists of equal size (split prompt)
2. For each sub-list: Sort the sub-list (sort prompt) five times; score each sort attempt; keep the best
3. Merge the sorted sub-lists into one fully sorted list (merge prompt) 10 times; score each merge attempt; keep the best
4. Fix any potential mistakes in the sorted list (improve prompt) 10 times; score each improvement attempt; keep the best

### Step 4 - Prompt
```
<Instruction> The following two lists represent an unsorted list of numbers and a sorted variant of that list. The sorted variant is not correct. Fix the sorted variant so that it is correct.
Make sure that the output list is sorted in ascending order, has the same number of elements as the input list (32), and contains the same elements as the input list. </Instruction>

<Approach>
To fix the incorrectly sorted list follow these steps:
1. For each number from 0 to 9, compare the frequency of that number in the incorrectly sorted list to the frequency of that number in the input list.
2. Iterate through the incorrectly sorted list and add or remove numbers as needed to make the frequency of each number in the incorrectly sorted list match the frequency of that number in the input list.
