### AGGREGATE: merge_prompt
Replace `{dictionary_1}` and `{dictionary_2}` with dictionaries of countries to be merged.
```
<Instruction> Combine the following 2 dictionaries, each containing the frequency of countries in a text, into a single dictionary.
Simply add the frequencies together for each country and if a country is not present in one of the dictionaries, add it to the final dictionary with the frequency from the other dictionary.
Only output the final merged dictionary without any additional text or thoughts!
</Instruction>

<Approach>
To combine the 2 dictionaries into single one, follow these steps:
1. Create a new dictionary to store the combined frequencies.
2. Iterate through the keys of the first dictionary and add the frequency of each country to the new dictionary.
3. Iterate through the keys of the second dictionary and add the frequency of each country to the new dictionary and if it is already present, add the frequency to the existing value.
</Approach>

Combine the following 2 dictionaries into a single dictionary:
{dictionary_1}
{dictionary_2}

Combined Output:
```

### IMPROVE: improve_merge_prompt
Replace `{dictionary_1}` and `{dictionary_2}` with dictionaries of countries
to be merged and `{dictionary_incorrect}` with incorrectly merged dictionary
to be improved.
```
<Instruction> The following 2 dictionaries were combined into the third dictionary below. However, some mistakes occured and the third dictionary is incorrect. Please fix the third dictionary so that it contains the correct frequencies for each country. The correct frequencies are the sum of the frequencies from the first 2 dictionaries. If a country is not present in one of the dictionaries, add it to the final dictionary with the frequency from the other dictionary.
</Instruction>

<Example>
Dictionary 1:
{
    "Peru": 2,
    "Chile": 1,
    "Uruguay": 1,
    "Paraguay": 1
}
Dictionary 2:

### Input
```
My friend, Alex from Peru, once recounted his journey to Argentina where he learned about the strong cultural ties between Argentina and Brazil due to their shared history.
He spoke fondly of his time in Argentina and Brazil, marveling at the similar music, dance, and culinary traditions that seamlessly bridged the borders of these countries.
It reminded me of a documentary I'd watched about the ancient Silk Road that spanned across Iran and China.
It touched upon the shared historical narratives of Iran and China, highlighting how goods, ideas, and culture flowed between these two countries for centuries.
Intriguingly, the documentary also brought up some parallels between this eastern route and the vibrant exchange between Italy and France during the Renaissance.
The cultural and intellectual bonds between Italy and France were indeed profound, just as the resilient trade relations that existed between the United States and Canada.
The United States and Canada, apart from their geographical proximity, shared an economic bond that strongly influenced their policies and international standing.
Similarly, the ties between Australia and New Zealand shed light on their gestalt identity in the Pacific region.
Despite their unique characteristics, Australia and New Zealand were often viewed as a single entity due to their remarkably similar backgrounds in terms of culture, language, and colonial history.
Inspired by these chronicles of interconnectedness, I decided to delve deeper into history and found a fascinating account of how Ukraine and Poland had influenced each other through years of coexistence.
Despite their tumultuous past, Ukraine and Poland shared a cultural tapestry that was deeply woven into their histories.
It was quite similar to the complex relationship between North Korea and South Korea, which, despite their political differences, shared common heritage and traditions.
Thus, from Argentina to South Korea, the world was an intricate web of countries intertwined with each other through shared histories, cultures, and sometimes, shared destinies.

Input:
The United States and Canada, apart from their geographical proximity, shared an economic bond that strongly influenced their policies and international standing. Similarly, the ties between Australia and New Zealand shed light on their gestalt identity in the Pacific region. Despite their unique characteristics, Australia and New Zealand were often viewed as a single entity due to their remarkably similar backgrounds in terms of culture, language, and colonial history. Inspired by these chronicles of interconnectedness, I decided to delve deeper into history and found a fascinating account of how Ukraine and Poland had influenced each other through years of coexistence.

<Instruction> Count the frequency of how many times each country is explicitly named in the input text. You can generate any intermedate lists and states, but the final output should only contain the frequency of each country that appears at least once in the following json format, prefixed with "Output: " (make sure to keep the same spelling for each country in the output as in the input text):
{
    "country1": frequency1,
    "country2": frequency2,
    ...
}
</Instruction>

<Approach>
To count the frequency for each country follow these steps:
1. Split the input passage into four paragraphs of similar length.
2. Count the frequency of each country in each paragraph.
3. Combine the frequencies of each country from each paragraph by adding them together.
</Approach>

Despite their tumultuous past, Ukraine and Poland shared a cultural tapestry that was deeply woven into their histories. It was quite similar to the complex relationship between North Korea and South Korea, which, despite their political differences, shared common heritage and traditions. Thus, from Argentina to South Korea, the world was an intricate web of countries intertwined with each other through shared histories, cultures, and sometimes, shared destinies.
