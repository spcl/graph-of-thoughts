1. Create a new dictionary to store the combined frequencies.
2. Iterate through the keys of the first dictionary and add the frequency of each country to the new dictionary.
3. Iterate through the keys of the second dictionary and add the frequency of each country to the new dictionary and if it is already present, add the frequency to the existing value.
</Approach>

Combine the following 2 dictionaries into a single dictionary:
{input1}

{input2}

Combined Output:
"""

However, some mistakes occured and the third dictionary is incorrect. Please fix the third dictionary so that it contains the correct frequencies for each country.
The correct frequencies are the sum of the frequencies from the first 2 dictionaries. If a country is not present in one of the dictionaries, add it to the final dictionary with the frequency from the other dictionary.
