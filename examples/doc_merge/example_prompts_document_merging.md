# Merging 4 NDAs - Prompts and Examples
## Prompt Templates
### GENERATE: merge_prompt
Replace `{doc1}`, `{doc2}`, `{doc3}`, and `{doc4}` with the NDAs to be merged.
```
Merge the following 4 NDA documents <Doc1> - <Doc4> into a single NDA, maximizing retained information and minimizing redundancy. Output only the created NDA between the tags <Merged> and </Merged>, without any additional text.
Here are NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>

</Doc4>
```

### SCORE: score_prompt
Replace `{doc1}`, `{doc2}`, `{doc3}`, and `{doc4}` with the NDAs that are supposed to be merged and `{s}` with the merged summary NDA that is to be scored.
```
The following NDA <S> merges NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>.
Please score the merged NDA <S> in terms of how much redundant information is contained, independent of the original NDAs, as well as how much information is retained from the original NDAs.
A score of 10 for redundancy implies that absolutely no information is redundant, while a score of 0 implies that at least half of the information is redundant (so everything is at least mentioned twice).
A score of 10 for retained information implies that all information from the original NDAs is retained, while a score of 0 implies that no information is retained.
You may provide reasoning for your scoring, but the final score for redundancy should be between the tags <Redundancy> and </Redundancy>, and the final score for retained information should be between the tags <Retained> and </Retained>, without any additional text within any of those tags.

### AGGREGATE: aggregate_prompt
Replace `{doc1}`, `{doc2}`, `{doc3}`, and `{doc4}` with the original NDAs that are supposed to be merged and `{s1}` - `{s{num_ndas_summaries}}` with the summary NDAs that are to be combined, where `{num_ndas_summaries}` is the number of summary NDAs.
```
The following NDAs <S1> - <S{num_ndas_summaries}> each merge the initial NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>.
Combine the merged NDAs <S1> - <S{num_ndas_summaries}> into a new one, maximizing their advantages and overall information retention, while minimizing redundancy.
Output only the new NDA between the tags <Merged> and </Merged>, without any additional text.

Here are the original NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>:

### Step 1 Scoring for Best Response - Prompt
```
The following NDA <S> merges NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>.
Please score the merged NDA <S> in terms of how much redundant information is contained, independent of the original NDAs, as well as how much information is retained from the original NDAs.
A score of 10 for redundancy implies that absolutely no information is redundant, while a score of 0 implies that at least half of the information is redundant (so everything is at least mentioned twice).
A score of 10 for retained information implies that all information from the original NDAs is retained, while a score of 0 implies that no information is retained.
You may provide reasoning for your scoring, but the final score for redundancy should be between the tags <Redundancy> and </Redundancy>, and the final score for retained information should be between the tags <Retained> and </Retained>, without any additional text within any of those tags.

Here are NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>:

### Step 1 Scoring for Best Response - 3 Responses
#### Response 1
```
<Redundancy>5</Redundancy>
<Retained>10</Retained>

Reasoning:
In terms of redundancy, there is some overlap in the information contained in the NDAs, such as the definition of "Confidential Information" and the obligations of the receiving party. However, there are also some unique details in each NDA, such as the specific purpose of information sharing and the penalties for breach. Overall, there is a moderate level of redundancy in the merged NDA.

In terms of retained information, all the key elements from the original NDAs are included in the merged NDA. This includes the agreement between the parties, the purpose of information sharing, the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the receiving party, the exclusions for confidential information, non-competition clauses, the term and termination of the agreement, and the general provisions. Therefore, the merged NDA retains all the important information from the original NDAs.
```

#### Response 2
```
<Redundancy>8</Redundancy>
<Retained>10</Retained>

Reasoning:
The merged NDA <S> contains multiple redundant sections from the original NDAs. For example, the introductory sections, such as the agreement between the parties and the purpose of information sharing, are repeated multiple times. Additionally, sections related to the definition of confidential information, the recipient's obligations, exclusions, non-competition, term and termination, and general provisions are also redundantly included.

However, in terms of retained information, the merged NDA retains all the key elements from the original NDAs, including the parties involved, the objective, specification of protected information, recipient's obligations, violation ramifications, general terms, legal reference, and attestation. Overall, while there is redundancy in the merged NDA, it successfully retains all the necessary information from the original NDAs.
```

#### Response 3
```
<Redundancy>3</Redundancy>
The merged NDA contains some redundancy. There are three sections that have overlapping information between the original NDAs. These sections include:

1. The agreement between the parties (Section 1 in Doc1 and the beginning of Doc2)
2. Information sharing and the purpose of the NDA (Section 2 in both Doc1 and Doc2)
3. General provisions such as governing law and amendments (Section 7 in Doc1 and Doc2)

<Retained>9</Retained>
The merged NDA retains a significant amount of information from the original NDAs. It includes all key clauses and provisions, such as the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the receiving party, exclusions, non-competition, and general provisions. Only a few minor details, such as specific penalties and fine amounts, are not retained in the merged NDA. Overall, the merged NDA effectively combines the essential elements from the original NDAs.

Note: Remember to remove the reasoning from between the tags when providing the final scores.

### Step 3 Scoring for Best Response - Prompt

```
The following NDA <S> merges NDAs <Doc1> - <Doc4>.
Please score the merged NDA <S> in terms of how much redundant information is contained, independent of the original NDAs, as well as how much information is retained from the original NDAs.
A score of 10 for redundancy implies that absolutely no information is redundant, while a score of 0 implies that at least half of the information is redundant (so everything is at least mentioned twice).
A score of 10 for retained information implies that all information from the original NDAs is retained, while a score of 0 implies that no information is retained.
You may provide reasoning for your scoring, but the final score for redundancy should be between the tags <Redundancy> and </Redundancy>, and the final score for retained information should be between the tags <Retained> and </Retained>, without any additional text within any of those tags.

### Step 3 Scoring for Best Response - 3 Responses

#### Response 1
```
<Redundancy>5</Redundancy>
<Retained>8</Retained>

Reasoning:
The merged NDA <S> retains most of the information from the original NDAs, combining relevant clauses and terms into a single comprehensive agreement. However, some redundancy is present as similar information is mentioned multiple times, such as the definition of "Confidential Information" and the obligations of the receiving party. Additionally, some specific details from the original NDAs are not included in the merged NDA, such as the exclusion criteria in Doc2 and the provisions for non-competition in Doc3 and Doc4. Nonetheless, the merged NDA captures the essence of the original NDAs and includes all key information necessary for a non-disclosure agreement.
```

#### Response 2
```
<Redundancy>8</Redundancy>
<Retained>10</Retained>

Reasoning:

The merged NDA <S> retains all the key information from the original NDAs, including the purpose of the agreement, the definition of confidential information, the obligations of the receiving party, breach penalties, applicability to parties and successors, governing law, and signature requirements.

There is some redundant information, such as the inclusion of system designs, architectural schematics, proprietary computational algorithms, internal software blueprints, and intellectual property awaiting patents from both Doc3 and Doc4. However, this redundancy is minor and does not significantly impact the overall usefulness of the NDA.

Overall, the merged NDA <S> retains all important information while minimizing redundancy, making it highly effective in conveying the necessary terms and obligations of the agreement. Therefore, it receives a score of 8 for redundancy and a score of 10 for retained information.
```

#### Response 3
```
<Redundancy>7</Redundancy>
<Retained>10</Retained>

Reasoning:
The merged NDA <S> contains some redundant information, such as the definition of "Confidential Information" and the obligations of the receiving party.
